        We've been experimenting with using the fruit from Syzygium luehmannii
        in wine making for some years now, initially with other fruits. We found
        the Australian native deserved to shine all by itself.

        It has a unique spicy tone with an aromatic flavour. Our sparkling is
        made in a p√©tillant naturel style and it is just the thing to mark a
        celebration or have as a little sundowner with some cheese.

        Syzygium leuhmanii is a type of Lilly Pilly and is one of the most
        robust and popular native plants. It has diverse uses and doesn't
        require high intensity care which makes it a perfect sustainable crop
        for the future. We're aspiring to have a farm that embraces regenerative
        agriculture and is part of a positive solution for productive lands.

      <p>We hope you enjoy this totally unique wine as much as we do!</p>
