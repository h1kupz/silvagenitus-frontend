          We've been experimenting with using the fruit from Syzygium luehmannii
          in wine making for some years now, initially with other fruits. We
          found the Australian native deserved to shine all by itself.

          It has a unique spicy tone with an aromatic flavour. Our sparkling is
          made in a p√©tillant naturel style and it is just the thing to mark a
          celebration or have as a little sundowner with some cheese.

          Syzygium leuhmanii is a type of Lilly Pilly and is one of the most
          robust and popular native plants. It has diverse uses and doesn't
          require high intensity care which makes it a perfect sustainable crop
          for the future. We're aspiring to have a farm that embraces
          regenerative agriculture and is part of a positive solution for
          productive lands.

        <p>We hope you enjoy this totally unique wine as much as we do!</p>
